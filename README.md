POS2SPM is a MATLAB-based conversion and formatting tool that can be applied to a number of different probe arrays and channel configurations using either 1 or 2 POS measurement files from an electromagnetic 3D digitizer. This conversion tool outputs the appropriately formatted files necessary to complete spatial registration of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data with the NIRS-SPM toolbox (SPM5 or SPM8), the SPM-fNIRS toolbox (SPM12), or both.
